**-- _Database.xlsx_**: Database including input variables (soil-bridge parameters) and output variables (type of failure process, displacement ductility factor, and strength hardening factor) used for surrogate modeling of the ductility indices of scoured bridge pile-group foundations at the easy-to-repair limit state.

**-- _Classification_Regression_Combination_Model.xlsx_**: A spreadsheet for the implementation of the developed CRCM. Please change the input variables to obtain the ductility indices.
