#This fold contains the database and associated Classification-Regression Combination Model (CRCM) (both in spreadsheet) for the following paper:

Wang J., Ye A., and Wang X. (202X) “Quantifying easy-to-repair displacement ductility and lateral strength of scoured bridge pile-group foundations in cohesionless soils: A classification-regression combination surrogate model.” Journal of Bridge Engineering, under review.

The following files are created by the first author, Mr. Jingcheng Wang, Email: jc_wang@tongji.edu.cn

-- Database.xlsx: Database including input variables (soil-bridge parameters) and output variables (type of failure process, displacement ductility factor, and strength hardening factor) used for surrogate modeling of the ductility indices of scoured bridge pile-group foundations at the easy-to-repair limit state.

-- Classification_Regression_Combination_Model.xlsx: A spreadsheet for the implementation of the developed CRCM. Please change the input variables to obtain the ductility indices.
